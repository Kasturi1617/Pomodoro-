# Pomodoro-
The pomodoro technique is a time management framework that improves focus and productivity.  The technique is working in 25-minute blocks (called pomodoro sessions), followed by 5-minute breaks. I have made a Graphical User Interface using Python that implements the Pomodoro technique and helps you stay productive :)
